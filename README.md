# PINNs (Physics-informed Neural Networks)

This is a another simple implementation of the Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) using ***PyTorch*** based on [jayroxis/PINNs](https://github.com/jayroxis/PINNs).

In this repository, a replica of solving WAVE EQUATION is done, following the experiment setup mentioned in the article:
